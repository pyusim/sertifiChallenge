This is my solution to the Sertifi coding challenge.

The project can be run from http://www.pavelyusim.com/sertifiChallenge/

It can also be built and run locally:

npm install
grunt build

Then run a server from the top level directory

The test cases are in the tests directory. Test cases can be run like this:

grunt unittests
